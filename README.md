# Luas_Location_Based_PushOver

Description
This is a script you have to combine with IFTT, DropBox and Pushover to receive location based Pushover notifications when your are near a LUAS train stop. It could trigger for anything and look up Dublin Bus, DART, and Trains as well. I use it for LUAS stops. I wrote a blog post with some descriptive words - http://www.happymillfam.com/near-the-luas-pushover/

Requirements
You need the following things to make this work:
- Pushover API Key you have to enter into the script
- Dropbox account you can link to IFTTT
- IFTTT account and application on your phone
- The NearLuas.txt file needs to be on your machine before the script will work.

Good luck.
